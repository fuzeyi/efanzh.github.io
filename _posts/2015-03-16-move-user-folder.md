title: An easier way to move your user folder
---

After I installed my Windows system, I like to move some of my user folders (like Desktop, Pictures, Videos) away from my system drive. So I right click the folder icon, choose “Properties”, switch to “Location” tab, then type the new path for my user folder. I have to do this for every user folder I want to move. It’s too much work. (Or I’m too lazy.)

Anyway, I found that If you want to move your user folder, just move them! I mean cut and paste. The mighty Windows will recognize your true intention and do the work for you. No more property dialogs, no more path typing, Yay!

# SwitchyOmega

The current auto switch rule list for GFW is:

> <https://autoproxy-gfwlist.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gfwlist.txt>

Notice that Google Code will be closed soon, so this list will not be available at that time. The new rule list will be at <http://gfwli.st/>. Although it’s not available at this moment, it will become usable when the migration is completed.
